  Introduction:
    "I'm Gautam, an engineering student in Nanyang Technological University with a keen interest in computer science. I made this site to hone my React skills (which were getting slightly rusty) and tell the world a bit about myself. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and documentaries, reading complex history books and hitting the gym. Not to mention learning about web design and full-stack web development. So if you'd like to get to know me better or you have a project which you'd like to collaborate on, just drop me an email!",
  Elaboration:
    "This is just a brief timeline of my life so far. Check out my resume and projects for more details. You can also filter the timeline by the acedemic and professional milestones in my life.",

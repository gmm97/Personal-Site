  AboutPrimaryElaboration:
    "I'm Gautam, an engineering student in Nanyang Technological University with a keen interest in computer science. I made this site to hone my React skills (which were getting slightly rusty) and tell the world a bit about myself. In my free time, I enjoy watching movies and documentaries, reading complex history books and hitting the gym. Not to mention learning about web design and full-stack web development. So if you'd like to get to know me better or you have a project which you'd like to collaborate on, just drop me an email!",

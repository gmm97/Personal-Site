  Introduction: "A note about my courses",
  Elaboration:
    "I've taken a great many courses throughout my undergraduate and master's journey, so it would be pointless to list them all out. Instead, I've just listed some interesting and relevant ones. However, if you'd like to see if I've taken a course beyond those in the list, just use the search button above. The course should still come up!",

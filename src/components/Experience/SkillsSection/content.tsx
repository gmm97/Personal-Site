Obviously it isn't always possible to know everything completely, so I've color-coded my skills according to those I'm more comfortable with. Green indicates that I've used the framework in many projects and am quite comfortable working with it. Yellow means I'm familiar with parts of the library but may not be completely familiar with the inner workings of the framework, and red means that I'm currently learning more about it as part of a project I'm doing.",

## Introduction

Production SQL databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Oracle Database and many others form a core part of a web developer's toolkit. When a front-end developer creates a website, a _backend_ is required for processing the request and returning a response. Often, for tasks such as user authentication, handling product listings and for pretty much everything where we need to _persist_ or store data in some form, we open a connection from our backend server to our production database and run _queries_ on a database table in a language such as Structured Query Language (SQL). But how should we structure those databases to ensure we follow the DRY paradigm? How do we decide which data to keep in separate tables and which data to store together? Can we somehow structure our tables to make our queries faster, if we know the exact data we are likely to be querying ahead of time? In the course of this project, I take a look at some of the technical aspects of database structure and performance while trying to recreate (a simplified version of) the Instagram database.

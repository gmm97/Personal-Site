## Introduction

Well, I would post a link to this site but that would be a bit pointless, right?

Anyways, I've had some experience in making traditional websites with HTML, CSS and plain Javascript before. But it isn't just that ReactJs is way easier to get a handle on (it is, by the way), and it isn't really about terms like the _virtual dom_ that people keep throwing around either. I find React amazing because of how _easy_ it makes your life! Specifically, with regards to the following:

- It is _so_ much easier to structure your files. React works with rendering JSX components on the screen - JSX is "Javascript React", a blend of HTML and Javascript arranged into components which you render onto the screen. This ensures you don't normally run into the problem with poorly-structured code causing your HTML elements to be affected by different chunks of vanilla Javascript from different files. You lose a bit of flexibility in the way you can structure your projects, but you gain so much peace of mind knowing that everything you need is right in front of you :)

- You can write controllable components with far less code, making simple user interaction really easy to customize. I shudder at how long it would have taken me to write the interactive timeline component on this website's home page if I hadn't used React.

- It has very few trade-off's. Earlier, issues such as poor Search Engine Optimization (SEO) rankings used to be a issue for large code bases. Nowadays, you can use Server Side Rendering with frameworks such as [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) to improve performance tremendously, while keeping your site all the way at the top of Google's rankings.

- At the risk of repeating myself, React is just _so easy_! Learning the way it works in-depth took me time, but the learning curve is gentle and the core features are here to stay. Once you get the hang of using Hooks and with a solid Javascript foundation, it won't take more than a few weeks to get up and running with your own projects.

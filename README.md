# Personal-Site

Developed using React StyledComponents (https://styled-components.com/).
Currently hosted on www.gautammanek.com

# Purpose

Will make regular edits to this repository after refactoring the code to make it more customizable.
For now, just clone this repo and run the following command inside the directory:

```
npm install
```

After that, access the .env file and change the following API_KEY to your own API_KEY, which can be generated here: https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstarts

Do NOT use the same API key, it will fail when deployed to production.

# Future-Plans

1. Add individual pages for projects
2. Add TS for type checking
3. If needed, use Redux to handle global state in application

# Personal-Site

Developed using React StyledComponents (https://styled-components.com/).
Currently hosted on www.gautammanek.com

# Purpose

Will make regular edits to this repository after refactoring the code to make it more customizable.
For now, just clone this repo and run the following command inside the directory:

```
npm install
```

After that, access the .env file and change the following API_KEY to your own API_KEY, which can be generated here: https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/quickstarts

Do NOT use the same API key, it will fail when deployed to production.

Along with StyledComponents, Typescript is used to ensure type-checking on all components. If the code is customized, take extra care before editing TS interfaces as they may be used in several components in the Website.

# Customizing the Content

Will add in further details here after further re-arranging and re-factoring. For now, all the content.ts files in the folders contain the interfaces and objects. Editing the objects will change data displayed on the FE.

# Current Advancements

1. Add elaborations for the individual project pages
